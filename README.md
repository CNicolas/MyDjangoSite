# MyDjangoSite
A Django web sites platform

## Technologies
 - Django 1.8
 - [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/) 0.9

I had before used Django as a backend server, but I wanted to use it directly in front.

And I thought it was the time to test Materialize, instead of the usual Bootstrap3 css framework.
